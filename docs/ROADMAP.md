# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the vision, current focus, and planned future enhancements for the Google Gemini TTS & AI Code Planner Frontend.

## Vision

To create a powerful, intuitive, and highly integrated suite of AI-powered developer tools, making complex tasks like speech generation and code modification accessible and efficient directly from the user's desktop.

## Current Focus (v0.1.0 - Initial Release)

-   **Robust Authentication:** Ensure secure and reliable user login via email/password, Google OAuth2, and GitHub OAuth2.
-   **Gemini Text-to-Speech:** Implement core TTS functionality allowing users to:
    -   Input text.
    -   Configure multiple speakers with voice profiles.
    -   Generate and play speech audio.
-   **AI Code Planner (MVP):** Provide foundational AI code planning capabilities, including:
    -   Defining project context (root directory, scan paths).
    -   Crafting AI instructions and expected output formats.
    -   Generating and displaying structured plans (add, modify, delete, repair, analyze).
    -   Applying individual or full plans to the local filesystem.
-   **User Experience:** Deliver a clean, responsive UI with light/dark mode support and clear feedback mechanisms.
-   **Core Infrastructure:** Establish a solid Vite/React/TypeScript foundation with Material UI and Tailwind CSS.

## Future Enhancements

### Short-Term (Next 1-3 Months)

-   **Enhanced AI Planner Features:**
    -   **Contextual Auto-completion:** Provide smarter suggestions for scan paths and file names based on the project structure.
    -   **Diff View for MODIFY/REPAIR:** Implement a visual diff tool within the `PlanDisplay` component to show proposed changes before application.
    -   **Undo/Rollback Mechanism:** Allow users to easily revert applied changes, possibly by integrating with Git staging/reset commands.
    -   **Pre-defined Plan Templates:** Offer templates for common refactoring or feature addition tasks to streamline planning.
    -   **Interactive File Tree Browser:** Improve `DirectoryPickerDrawer` to allow actual browsing of local directories (requires backend support for file listing).
-   **TTS Improvements:**
    -   **Voice Customization:** More granular control over speech parameters (pitch, speed, volume).
    -   **Speaker Management:** Save and load speaker profiles.
    -   **Export Options:** Allow exporting generated audio in different formats (e.g., MP3, OGG).
-   **Notifications & Feedback:** More prominent success/error notifications for plan generation and application.

### Medium-Term (Next 3-6 Months)

-   **Advanced AI Capabilities:**
    -   **Code Analysis & Refactoring Suggestions:** Proactive suggestions for code improvements.
    -   **Automated Testing Plan Generation:** AI-generated test plans and even test code based on feature descriptions.
    -   **Multi-Modal AI Input:** Support for image/screenshot input for the AI planner (e.g., "make UI look like this").
-   **Project Integration:**
    -   **Git Integration:** Deeper integration with Git, including branch management, commit message generation, and pull request drafting.
    -   **Monorepo Support:** Improved handling and context management for monorepo structures.
-   **User Customization & Presets:** Save and manage custom AI instructions, output schemas, and default planner settings.

### Long-Term (6+ Months)

-   **Collaborative Features:** Allow teams to share plans, review changes, and collaborate on code generation.
-   **Plugin Architecture:** Enable community-driven extensions for different AI models, frameworks, or tools.
-   **Desktop Application:** Explore Electron or Tauri for a native desktop experience with deeper filesystem integration.
-   **Cloud Integration:** Connect with cloud-based development environments or CI/CD pipelines.
-   **Learning & Adaptation:** AI models that learn from user feedback and preferences to provide increasingly accurate and helpful suggestions.
